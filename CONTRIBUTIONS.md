We welcome and encourage all contributions to this project. 

## How to Get Started for Noobs
This project uses python to run; you definetly need python. 

There are other requirements which are found in this [file](./app/requirements.txt).

If you are on a unix like environment you can use the [automated script](./app/requirements_installer.sh) to install all of these requirements. 

More information about the installation can be found [here](./app/docs/installation.md).

### Running API Locally
To run the api simply navigate to the app directory and run ```uvicorn main:app```

This will run the api locally which you can find under, http://127.0.0.1:8000. 

## Documentation
You can find lots of information in our [documentaion folder](./app/docs/).

In particular [DESIGN.md](./app/docs/DESIGN.md) can be really helpful to give you information about the design decisions made in the project. 

## Making a Pull Request
Please work on a branch that is named after the issue you are working on. 

Make sure that your pull request adequately describes the changes that you have made. 

We ask that you test the api, make any necessary translations and changes to the documentation before making your changes. 

We wish you all the best.
